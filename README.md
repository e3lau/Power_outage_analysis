#POWER OUTAGE ANALYSIS
A UCSD DSC 80 Project, by Ethan Lau

## Introduction
### 1.1: General Overview
- This project centralizes around the power outages dataset which contains a listing of 1,534 major power outages occuring between January of 2000 to July 2016. The outages reported in this data file affected a single U.S. state at the time of each outage occurrence.

### 1.2: Research Question
- The primary question of research to which this project will analyze how geographical and urban charteristics of each state effect the restoration time of a power outage. Investigating how different demographic factors (such as urban vs. rural populations, population density, and percentage of urban population) correlate with power outage impacts (customers affected, duration) can help in understanding which communities are most vulnerable and need targeted interventions.
